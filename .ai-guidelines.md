# AI Coding Guidelines for RIAA LADSPA Plugin

This document provides guidelines for AI assistants working on this project.

## General Principles

1. **No Emojis**: Do not use emojis anywhere in the project - not in code, comments, commit messages, documentation, or README files
2. **Professional Documentation**: Maintain a professional, technical tone suitable for audio engineering software
3. **Code Quality**: Follow existing code patterns and conventions found in the codebase

## C Code Standards

- Follow the existing code style for consistency
- Use standard C (C99 or later)
- Include proper error handling
- Add comments for complex algorithms, especially DSP code
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Use descriptive variable names

## LADSPA-Specific Rules

- **Port Order**: Control inputs → Control outputs → Audio inputs → Audio outputs
- **activate() Function**: Only reset internal DSP state, never modify control port values
- **Real-time Safe**: Avoid malloc/free in run() function, no file I/O, no blocking operations
- **NULL Checks**: Always check control port pointers before dereferencing
- **Sample Rates**: Support standard rates: 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, 192 kHz

## Documentation Standards

- Use markdown for all documentation
- Use text-based formatting: **bold**, *italic*, `code`, > quotes
- For warnings/alerts: Use "WARNING:", "NOTE:", "IMPORTANT:" in bold or caps
- Include practical examples in documentation
- Explain technical concepts clearly without dumbing down

## DSP Code

- Document filter coefficients and their derivation
- Include references to standard DSP formulas where applicable
- Explain normalization and sign conventions
- Add debug output judiciously (only to stderr, removable for production)

## Version Control

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- No emojis in commit messages or branch names
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes
